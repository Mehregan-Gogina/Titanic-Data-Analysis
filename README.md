# Titanic Data Analysis

This repository contains a data analysis project of the Computational Intelligence course on the Titanic dataset. The analysis is performed using Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Overview

The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset in data science and machine learning. It contains information about the passengers who were on board the Titanic, including details such as their age, sex, ticket class, and whether they survived or not. The goal of this project is to analyze the dataset and extract meaningful insights.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

## Analysis

The analysis is performed using Jupyter Notebook. The following steps are taken in the analysis:

1. Data Loading: Load the dataset into a Jupyter Notebook.
2. Data Cleaning: Clean the dataset by handling missing values and removing unnecessary columns.
3. Data Exploration: Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of different features and their relationships.
4. Data Visualization: Visualize the dataset using various plots to gain insights.
5. Model Building: Build machine learning models to predict the survival of passengers.

## Requirements

The following libraries are required to run the analysis:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

To run the analysis, open the Jupyter Notebook (`titanic.ipynb`) and execute the cells. The notebook contains detailed explanations and code for each step of the analysis.

## Results

The notebook summarizes the analysis results. Key findings and insights are highlighted, and the performance of the machine learning models is evaluated.
